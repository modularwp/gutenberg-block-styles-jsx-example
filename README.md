# Gutenberg Block: Block Styles - JSX Example

 This WordPress plugin is an example Gutenberg block with custom CSS styles. It is built using JSX/ES6. It comes with two CSS files. The first file (style.css) is applied to both the editor and the frontend. The second file (editor.css) is only applied to the editor. This plugin was written as part of a [Gutenberg blocks tutorial](https://modularwp.com/how-to-build-gutenberg-blocks/) for [ModularWP](https://modularwp.com/).
